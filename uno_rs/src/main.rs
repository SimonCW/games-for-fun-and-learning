// Trying to implement the game logic in a more functional style. This would allow to test scenarios more
// easily, i.e., have one function that takes necessary inputs. But should it be a pure func and just return
// a new deck? Or should it mutate the deck and return just the topmost card or sth. like this?
// I'd like to do without mutation but that seems kinda hard with Games where basically the whole
// thing revolves around one shared mutable state.
// Still, containing the muatation in one function would be better than having it spread out all over the place.
