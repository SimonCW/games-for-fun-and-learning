# Games for Fun and Learning

Just implementing (simulations of) games for fun. This is the ideal programming task for me while on parental leave because I can go straight into programming without distractions. I mostly have short time windows of 10-30 mins at a time, so I set myself the following constraints to maximize pure coding and fun:
* No researching on the internet for libraries, other implementations, etc. (very few exceptions) 
* No ChatGPT, no Copilot (takes the fun away)
* No new big libraries to avoid needing to learn their API (Rust is a bit of an exception since the standard library is not as extensive as Python's)
* No planning of features, just coding (code one to throw away)
* Always end the session with a bug or an open Todo
