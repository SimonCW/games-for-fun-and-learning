# Games for Fun and Learning

Just implementing games or rather simulations of games (e.g. to test out strategies) for fun. This is the ideal programming task for me while on parental leave because I can go straight into programming without distractions. I mostly have short time windows of 10-30 mins at a time, so I set myself the following constraints to maximize pure coding and fun:
* No researching on the internet for libraries, other implementations, etc. (very few exceptions) 
* No ChatGPT, no Copilot (takes the fun away)
* No new big libraries to avoid needing to learn their API (Rust is a bit of an exception since the standard library is not as extensive as Python's)
* No planning of features, just coding (code one to throw away)
* Always end the session with a bug or an open Todo
